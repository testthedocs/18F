Don't use e.g., or i.e., And in a list of one, two, and three items don't use an oxford comma.

If you are between one and three don't "join," it's not much of a fix and has too much hidden meaning. It's better that you do one, two, and three. One space please when user-testing. And use your API (application programming interface) properly.
